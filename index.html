        When it's your turn, place a ring on the board adjacent to other objects
        with your color (or anywhere, if you don't have any objects on the
        board). When you've placed 3 rings in a row, you must combine them into
        a tower. And likewise, 3 towers make a laser.
      </div>

      <div class="instructions">
        Towers will prevent the enemy from having objects adjacent to them in
        any direction (including diagonally). Lasers protect an entire row and
        column, making them very powerful at boxing your opponent in.

        The goal of the game is to prevent your opponent from being able to
        place any objects on the board.
